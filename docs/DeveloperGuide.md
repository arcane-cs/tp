## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `contact delete 1`.
<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `ViewPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("contact delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `contact delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteContactCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteContactCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteContactCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve. 
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`. 
5. If the command implements the `UndoableCommand` interface, `LogicManager` pushes it onto the `commandHistory` stack so it can be reversed by a subsequent `undo` command.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteContactCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g., during testing.
### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Copy Command Feature
The `copy` command allows users to quickly serialize a specific contact's complex profile (including their name, games, and aliases) into a perfectly formatted, executable CLI string (e.g., `contact add n/John Doe g/Valorant...`) and saves it directly to their operating system's clipboard.

#### Architecture and Execution
To avoid cluttering the main logic architecture diagram, the structural relationship of the `CopyCommand` is shown in the feature-specific class diagram below.

![CopyCommandClassDiagram](images/CopyCommandClassDiagram.png)

The command execution heavily relies on the `Logic` and `Model` components to retrieve the target contact, format the string, and then interfaces with the external OS `Clipboard`.

Step-by-step execution:
1. The user launches the application and inputs `copy 1` into the `CommandBox`.
2. `LogicManager` passes the input to `AddressBookParser`, which maps the command word to the `CopyCommandParser`.
3. `CopyCommandParser` parses the index, creates a `CopyCommand` object, and returns it.
4. `LogicManager` calls `CopyCommand#execute(model)`.
5. The command fetches the target `Person` from the `Model` using the provided index.
6. The command formats the person's attributes into a valid CLI string.
7. The command fetches the system `Clipboard` and sets its content to the formatted string.
8. A `CommandResult` is returned to indicate success.

The following sequence diagram illustrates this interaction:

![CopySequenceDiagram](images/CopySequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations:
* **Alternative 1 (Current):** Interface directly with the `Clipboard` within the `CopyCommand` execution logic, but use a mock/stub clipboard for testing.
    * **Pros:** Keeps the command highly cohesive and straightforward.
    * **Cons:** Requires careful testing setup to ensure CI/CD pipelines (which run in headless Linux environments without physical clipboards) do not crash with `IllegalStateException`.
* **Alternative 2:** Have the `CopyCommand` return the generated string inside the `CommandResult`, and force the `MainWindow` (UI) to push it to the clipboard.
    * **Pros:** Avoids headless testing issues entirely since the Logic component never touches the OS.
    * **Cons:** Violates the separation of concerns. The UI should merely display results, not execute system-level operations meant to be triggered by a specific command.

---

### Command History Navigation (Up/Down Arrows)
To improve the Quality of Life (QoL) of the CLI interface, users can navigate their session's command history using the Up and Down arrow keys.

#### Architecture and Execution
A naive implementation would store the history state directly inside the UI's `CommandBox`. However, UI components are notoriously difficult to test automatically without relying on heavy frameworks like TestFX.

To maintain strict adherence to testability, the state tracking logic is completely decoupled into a standalone `CommandHistory` class within the `Logic` component.

Step-by-step execution:
1. The user presses the Up arrow key in the text field.
2. The `CommandBox` triggers the `handleKeyPress(KeyEvent)` method.
3. The `CommandBox` queries the `CommandHistory` logic class via `getPrevious()`.
4. If a previous command exists, the text field is updated, and the cursor (`caret`) is forcefully positioned at the end of the loaded string.

The following sequence diagram proves the UI-Logic decoupling during this interaction:

![CommandHistorySequenceDiagram](images/CommandHistorySequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations:
* **UI vs Logic State Tracking:** By placing `CommandHistory.java` inside the `logic` package, we achieve 100% test coverage of the pointer math (including floor and ceiling boundary checks) using standard, lightning-fast headless JUnit tests, entirely bypassing the JavaFX Toolkit lifecycle.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature
### Editing a contact's name feature

#### Implementation

The `contact edit` command allows users to rename an existing contact while preserving all associated games and aliases. It is implemented via `EditContactCommand`, parsed by `EditContactCommandParser`, and routed through `ContactCommandParser`.

**Parsing flow:**
1. `AddressBookParser` receives `"contact edit 1 e/Jan"` (or `"contact edit n/Janelle e/Jan"`) and dispatches to `ContactCommandParser`.
2. `ContactCommandParser` splits on the first token (`"edit"`) and delegates the remaining args to `EditContactCommandParser`.
3. `EditContactCommandParser` tokenizes using `PREFIX_NAME` (`n/`) and `PREFIX_NEW_NAME` (`e/`). It then determines the target via `ParserUtil.verifyIndexOrNamePresent` — either an index from the preamble, a name from `n/`, or `0` for the user profile — and returns an `EditContactCommand(targetIndex, targetName, newName, useUserProfile)`.

**Execution flow:**
1. `EditContactCommand#execute()` resolves the target `Person`:
   * If `useUserProfile` is true, retrieves the user profile via `model.getUserProfile()`.
   * If `targetIndex` is set, retrieves the person at that index from the filtered list.
   * If `targetName` is set, searches `model.getFilteredPersonList()` for a case-insensitive name match.
2. If not found, a `CommandException` with `MESSAGE_PERSON_NOT_FOUND` is thrown.
3. A new `Person` is created with `newName` and the original person's `games`, and `isUserProfile` flag.
4. If the new name already belongs to a different person, a `CommandException` with `MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_PERSON` is thrown.
5. `model.setPerson()` replaces the old entry, and the filtered list is reset to show all persons.
6. A `CommandResult` is returned, displaying the updated contact.

**Design considerations:**

* **Immutable `Person` model** — `Person` objects are immutable; editing creates a new `Person` rather than mutating the existing one. This keeps the model simple and consistent with the rest of the codebase.
* **Index and name-based lookup** — The command supports both index and name identification, consistent with `alias edit` and `view`. A single constructor `(Index, Name, Name, boolean)` is used with the unused field passed as `null`, matching the pattern used by `EditAliasCommand`.
* **Games and aliases preserved** — The new `Person` is constructed with the original person's `games` map, so all associated data is retained after a rename.

### Undo feature

#### Implementation

The undo mechanism is implemented using a **command history stack** managed by `LogicManager`, together with an `UndoableCommand` interface that undoable commands implement.

**Key classes involved:**

* `UndoableCommand` (interface) — declares `void undo(Model model)`, which each undoable command implements to reverse its own effect.
* `UndoCommand` — pops the most recent command from the history stack and calls its `undo()` method.
* `LogicManager` — owns the history stack (`Deque<UndoableCommand> commandHistory`) and pushes commands onto it after successful execution.

**How the history stack is maintained:**

After a command executes successfully, `LogicManager` checks whether it implements `UndoableCommand`. If it does, the command is pushed onto the `commandHistory` deque (used as a LIFO stack). Read-only commands (e.g. `list`, `find`) do not implement `UndoableCommand` and are never added to history.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** `UndoCommand` itself is not pushed to history — it is created directly in `LogicManager` when the keyword `undo` is detected, bypassing the parser.

</box>

**How each command reverses itself (per-command state capture):**

Rather than saving a full snapshot of the address book after each command, each undoable command captures only what it needs:

| Command | State captured | Undo action |
|---|---|---|
| `AddContactCommand` | The `Person` added | `model.deletePerson(toAdd)` |
| `DeleteContactCommand` | The `Person` deleted (set after confirmation) | `model.addPerson(deletedPerson)` |
| `ClearCommand` | Full `AddressBook` snapshot (before clear) | `model.setAddressBook(previousAddressBook)` |
| `AddGameCommand` | `personBeforeEdit`, `personAfterEdit` | `model.setPerson(personAfterEdit, personBeforeEdit)` |
| `DeleteGameCommand` | `personBeforeEdit`, `personAfterEdit` | `model.setPerson(personAfterEdit, personBeforeEdit)` |
| `AddAliasCommand` | `personBeforeEdit`, `personAfterEdit` | `model.setPerson(personAfterEdit, personBeforeEdit)` |
| `DeleteAliasCommand` | `personBeforeEdit`, `personAfterEdit` | `model.setPerson(personAfterEdit, personBeforeEdit)` |
| `EditContactCommand` | `personBeforeEdit`, `personAfterEdit` | `model.setPerson(personAfterEdit, personBeforeEdit)` |
| `EditAliasCommand` | `personBeforeEdit`, `personAfterEdit` | `model.setPerson(personAfterEdit, personBeforeEdit)` |

**Special case — delete confirmation:**

`DeleteContactCommand` requires the user to confirm before the deletion is committed. The command is only pushed to `commandHistory` after the user confirms with `y`/`yes`. Cancelling the deletion means nothing is added to history.

Given below is an example usage scenario showing how the undo mechanism behaves.

Step 1. The user executes `contact add n/David` to add a new contact. `AddContactCommand` executes, stores the added `Person`, and is pushed onto `commandHistory`.

Step 2. The user executes `game add n/David g/Chess` to add a game. `AddGameCommand` executes, stores `personBeforeEdit` and `personAfterEdit`, and is pushed onto `commandHistory`.

Step 3. The user executes `undo`. `LogicManager` creates `UndoCommand(commandHistory)`. It pops `AddGameCommand` from the stack and calls its `undo()`, which calls `model.setPerson(personAfterEdit, personBeforeEdit)`, restoring David's original state.

Step 4. The user executes `undo` again. `UndoCommand` pops `AddContactCommand` and calls its `undo()`, which calls `model.deletePerson(toAdd)`, removing David entirely.

Step 5. The user executes `undo` again. The history stack is empty, so `UndoCommand` throws a `CommandException` with the message `"Error: Nothing to undo."`

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation flows through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo executes:**

* **Current choice:** Per-command state capture — each command stores only the data it needs to reverse itself.
  * Pros: Low memory overhead; no full address book snapshots needed for most commands.
  * Cons: Every new undoable command must correctly implement `undo()`.

* **Alternative:** Save a full address book snapshot after every command (VersionedAddressBook approach).
  * Pros: Simpler to implement per command — no per-command state logic needed.
  * Cons: Higher memory usage, especially with large contact lists.

**Aspect: No redo support:**

Redo is not implemented. Once a command is undone it is removed from the history stack permanently.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Delete Confirmation Feature
The `contact delete`, `game delete`, and `alias delete` commands require a y/n confirmation from the user before deletion is applied, to prevent accidental data loss.

#### Architecture and Execution
The structural relationship of the delete commands is shown in the class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteCommandClassDiagram.puml" alt="Delete Command Class Diagram" />

All three delete commands implement `ConfirmableDeleteCommand`, which declares `performDeletion()` and `getCancelMessage()`. This gives `LogicManager` a single unified code path for all confirmation handling.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the two-step flow for `contact delete n/Alice` followed by `y`:

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteConfirmSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Delete Confirmation Sequence Diagram" />

Step-by-step execution:
1. The user inputs `contact delete n/Alice`.
2. `LogicManager` passes the input to `AddressBookParser`, which creates a `DeleteContactCommand`.
3. `LogicManager` calls `DeleteContactCommand#execute(model)`, which finds the target but does **not** delete yet — returns a `CommandResult` with `isAwaitingConfirmation = true`.
4. `LogicManager` stores the command in `pendingConfirmableCommand` and shows the confirmation prompt.
5. The user inputs `y` — `LogicManager#handleDeleteConfirmation()` calls `performDeletion()` on the command, conditionally pushes it to `commandHistory` if it implements `UndoableCommand`, and saves the address book.
6. If the user inputs `n` or any other input, `getCancelMessage()` is returned and the model is unchanged.

#### Design Considerations:
* **`ConfirmableDeleteCommand` is decoupled from `UndoableCommand`** — allows future commands to require confirmation without needing to support undo. All three current delete commands implement both interfaces explicitly.
* **Alternative:** Have `LogicManager` perform the deletion directly (e.g. `model.deletePerson()`) after confirmation, without a `performDeletion()` method on the command.
    * **Pros:** Simpler — no extra interface or method needed.
    * **Cons:** `LogicManager` must know the internals of each delete command (e.g. which game or alias to remove), violating separation of concerns and requiring `instanceof` checks for each command type.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancement**

Team size: 5
* <b>Make the command result window to scale with text.</b> The current command result window is too small to fully view the result of the command. This might prevent users from viewing the full result without breaking from "full CLI"
* <b>Make the Contact List panel scroll without mouse input.</b> The current Contact List panel can only be manipulated with a mouse (barring the find command to reduce the size of the list) once again breaking from "full CLI"
* <b>Modify the scaling of components when application window is resized.</b> Currently, resizing the application window makes the command result wider, and the bottom view panels the same scaling, which does not translate well for the user experience on larger screens.
